## My contribution
My main contribution to my team's efforts of building a browser extension was writing the intallation instructions into the README file, since I was not so proficient in JavaScript.

## State of the browser extension
The main component of the browser is complete - it currently replaces "the" with "MEME" on the webpage, "B" with a red "B", and images with randome memes. We will have a working product by the due date.

## Learning about Github
One thing I learned about Github this week would be how to clone a repository onto my local machine.
