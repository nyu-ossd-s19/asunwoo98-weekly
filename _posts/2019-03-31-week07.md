Team project and Wikipedia

## Team Project Progress
So far, we have looked at the issue tracker and identified a few issues we think we can work on. I took a look at one of them myself, and even found a grammar error that I can report. I will be working more on that one issue I looked at next week.

## Wikipedia
In my opinion, the people who contribute articles to Wikipedia generally know enough about the topic and some sources to inform others about it. I don't think I would regularly make contributions to Wikipedia. I think I'll select articles by choosing something that I either find interesting or know a little something about. In Jimmy Wales' TED talk, I think the idea that professors and teachers hate Wikipedia is kind of out of date. While it is true that they do not want students to be using Wikipedia as a source, I think the majority of my teachers have said it is ok to use Wikipedia as a starting point to gain a general sense of some topic, and use the sources the page lists.
