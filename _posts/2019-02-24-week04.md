My entry for week 4.

## Hexo
Hexo is a "fast, simple & powerful blog framework". It uses Node.js, and supports Markdown. It can also install many plugins for Jade, CoffeeScript plugins. I mainly picked this project because it is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript is a language I would like to learn. It also builds a website, which was something else I wanted to see in action.
