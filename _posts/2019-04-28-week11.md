## Team Project
This week I fixed some issues with the pull request I sent last week. I was able to fix the issue by refactoring some other parts of the code in addition to the parts I was originally looking at. I've also started investigating the bigger issue our group is supposed to be working on together, and will continue to work on that with the team in the next week.
