Kevin Fleming's Talk

## Kevin Fleming's Talk
The most interesting thing about his talk was how Bloomberg is involved in open-source. It made perfect sense. They developed something they needed for their own terminal, and if it was generally applicable for other users, they give it back to the open-source community. The most surprising thing was that implementation of the average function when the work is distributed in parallel came to be developed. Surely it was not a trivial implementation, and yet it was all done by a summer intern. 

## Team Project
This week I fixed the issue I started looking a last week and submitted a pull request. I've learned that unit testing is indeed an extremely helpful tool in bigger projects with newbies coming in all the time. Changing one small component can easily break other parts of the code. Similar to last week, next week I will be looking for another issue to fix as well as a larger issue to work on as a group.
