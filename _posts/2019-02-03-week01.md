### Open Source
When I hear  the term "open source", I tend to think of the software smaritans on the internet put out for free to the convenience of other people. I was most liekly influence by the fact that I started off as a user of open source software, like many other people.

The advantage of open source over closed souce is that the source code is available to be viewed legally. This is transparency is important if you want to know what exactly the code does. It also allows the user to alter the code to their own benefit if necessary.

Some potential problem with open souce might include:
*Conflicting Interests
  * When multiple contributors are making their own changes to the project, sometimes they might end up with incompatible or even conflicting ideas
*Anyone can use
  * Since anyone can use it, the software can cause a great deal of harm if someone used it in a malicious way
 
Personally, I decided to register for this open source class since I wanted to learn more about open source, and to get some practical experience working on an open source project.
