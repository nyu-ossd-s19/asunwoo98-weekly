HFOSS.

## HFOSS
Projects for social good and humanitarian goals in mind are harder in to get involved with in the sense that there is more pressure on the developer to create something that is working and useful. One of the requirements in HFOSS is that it is mission critical: it must be work and produce useful results, and preferably as quickly as possible in the case of sudden disasters. Techincally wise, it seems like they should be similar to all other open-source projects, and depends on the developer's skills.

The prestige a HFOSS project brings also depends on the developer, and depends on their beliefs. If humanitarian efforts is something the developer is truly passionate about, then it would be most prestigeous of all other projects. On the other hand, there are many projects that are not open-source that can also be considered "prestigeous". For example, one might consider working on MATLAB prestigeous, since it is a program used by so many people in different fields all over the world for educational and research purposes. It would be more intellectually prestigeous. So it depends on how one defines prestigeous. For me personally, I'd say contributing to a HFOSS project would bring just a bit more prestige to the contributor.
