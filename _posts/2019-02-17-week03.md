My entry for week 3.

## My experience with creating the browser extension
It was very easy to work with my team members. It felt like we were all trying to get a working product and did what we could.

Decisions were made by people bring up their idea to everyone and see if everyone agreed it would be a good fit. Discussions were conducted mainly over a group chat on Facebook.
